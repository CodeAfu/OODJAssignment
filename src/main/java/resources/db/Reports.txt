The current support system relies heavily on manual intervention, leading to delays in issue resolution and dissatisfaction among customers. To address this, the project will focus on developing an intelligent chatbot system capable of understanding and responding to customer queries in real-time. Additionally, a knowledge base will be built to provide self-service options for common issues, reducing the workload on support agents. The project will be implemented in phases, starting with the development of the chatbot's core functionalities and gradually expanding its capabilities based on user feedback and performance metrics. The ultimate goal is to streamline the support process, improve response times, and ultimately enhance the overall customer experience.","submitted":false,"dateSubmitted":null,"moodleLink":"https://www.moodle.com/reports/13","studentMark":0,"totalMark":100,"feedback":null}]
